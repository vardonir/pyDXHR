# pyDXHR Documentation


Python-based tools for data exploration and extraction of Deus Ex Human Revolution, intended for use in another project of mine: [Project SI-X](https://six.vardonir.com/)

Although I went a bit too far and somehow managed to make mod tools?

This page will detail documentation for the tools + some notes on stuff I've found while digging through the files.

## Usage

Come back later.
