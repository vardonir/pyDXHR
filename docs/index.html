<h1>pyDXHR</h1>

<p>Python-based tools for data exploration and extraction of Deus Ex Human Revolution, intended for use in another project of mine: <a href="https://six.vardonir.com/">Project SI-X</a></p>

<p>Although I went a bit too far and somehow managed to make mod tools?</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Come back later.</p>

<h2>Branches</h2>

<p>I want to keep the mod stuff separate from the data mining stuff, so there's the freneticpony branch and the nucl3arsnake branch. If you can't tell which branch is which, go read some emails around Sarif Industries.</p>

<h3>freneticpony</h3>

<p>Refactoring some stuff.</p>

<h3>nucl3arsnake</h3>
