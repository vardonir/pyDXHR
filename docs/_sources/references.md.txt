## DXHR
- [Erika's Blender tools](https://github.com/rrika/dxhr) and [decompilation](https://github.com/rrika/cdcEngineDXHR)  

This entire project would not be possible without these projects. The Blender tools gave me a starting point since I already knew Python, and the decompilation was a fantastic reference for understanding the DRM and section file structure.

- [Steven's Gas Machine by semory @ XNALara](http://www.xnalara.org/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=1001)

The source code for this one was great for understanding how reading bigfiles worked.
