# pyDXHR Documentation


Python-based tools for data exploration and extraction of Deus Ex Human Revolution, intended for use in another project of mine: [Project SI-X](https://six.vardonir.com/)

Although I went a bit too far and somehow managed to make mod tools?

This page will detail documentation for the tools + some notes on stuff I've found while digging through the files.

## Usage

I'm planning to finalize this to an importable python package and/or something that can be run from the commandline, but not anytime soon. In the meantime, if you know what you're doing, I have the poetry file that I used to build the environment for the package. In this version, the only main external dependencies are `tqdm`, `fastcrc` and `numpy`. Later versions use `Pillow` and `kaitaistruct`

## Progress

- [x] Read MUL files and export to FSB
- [ ] Read RenderMesh sections and export to GLTF 
- [ ] Read RenderResource sections (i.e., textures) and export to DDS/TGA
