# Nobody asked for this: The Japanese Dub

![Banner](../_static/bnr_deusex.png)


Nobody asked for this, but here it is anyway. The Japanese dub, ported from the PS3 version. 

Cinematics are still in English, all TML audio will still be English (I'm not sure if it was released for the PS3 version?), sound effects are still in English (like the "access granted" part when you hack a terminal). 

I don't think porting the cinematics is worth it since it just adds 2.5GB of files for a few minutes of cutscenes.

More technical notes to come when I feel like writing them.

ps: afaik, the PC version was never released in Japan.
