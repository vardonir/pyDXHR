# About

pyDXHR was intended for use in another project of mine: [Project SI-X](https://six.vardonir.com/). I wanted a pipeline to go from game files to a usable model format with as minimal processes in the middle.

I went a bit too far. I ended up making prototype mod tools, I guess?

I'm literally just reading code made by people smarter than I am, and piecing them together. 

This website is an attempt to make the docs look and feel like a professionally-written document. The imperative here is "attempt."
