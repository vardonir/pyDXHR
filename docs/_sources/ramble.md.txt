# The Ramble Page

In which Vardonir talks about stuff.

## Motivation

All the other tools ([except for one](https://github.com/rrika/dxhr)) that I found for extracting assets for Crystal Engine, the proprietary game engine that DXHR uses, are written in either C# or C++ ([these tools are listed in the references page of pyDXHR's documentation](references.md))... which is fine and dandy if you speak those languages. I don't. And I wanted to get a ton of in-game assets from DXHR [for another project of mine](https://six.vardonir.com/).

Okay, so why not just use those tools and be done with it? I wish. What if I only wanted a certain class of models in this export? What if I wanted the models not to have textures attached to them on another export? What if I wanted to do some preprocessing on the models that Blender can't handle? It's unbelievable how often things like this come up, especially when dealing with something as complex as Unreal Engine 5.

I don't speak C++ (yet) or C# (anymore), so even if those tools are open-source (which I love - it's the reason why I've stuck around this project for so long), I can't edit them for my purposes. But I do speak Python. So, I took the codebases from those other Crystal Engine projects, studied them, and lumped them together into this.
