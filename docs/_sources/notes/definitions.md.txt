# Definitions

* Base game/Vanilla - non-director's cut version of the game. That oversaturated one with the piss filter.
* DC - director's cut

* IMF - intermediate mesh...? eh, I don't know either. These are the stuff you can only collide with, but not pick up or throw.
* Objects - stuff that you, the player, can interact with - items, weapons, throwables, those sorts of things.
