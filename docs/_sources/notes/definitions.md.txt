# Definitions

## Game terms

* Base game/Vanilla - non-director's cut version of the game. That oversaturated one with the gold filter.
* DC - director's cut. The one that you can actually buy as of 2023.
* TML - [The Missing Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymtCllSsfcg), which was distributed as a separate .exe originally + later integrated into the DC version of the game. I believe it also comes as a separate PKG on PS3.

* Xenon - refers to the Xbox version of the game. This documentation uses Xbox and Xenon interchangeably.

## Technical

* IMF - intermediate mesh...? eh, I don't know either. These are the stuff you can only collide with, but not pick up or throw.
* Objects - stuff that you, the player, can interact with - items, weapons, throwables, those sorts of things.
* Unit - sections of a map - for example, the `det_city_sarif` unit is the area around Sarif Industries + the LIMB clinic + the entrance to the convention center
