# AV data

## Video 

The video files are stored using the USM format developed by CRI Middleware. There is no compression being done on these files. Tools like VGM toolbox can decompress these files.

## Audio

There appears to be three "audio"(?) formats used in the game - MUL, SAM, MUS.

### MUL

MULtiplexed Audio File.

Aside: MUL files between different versions of the game are practically identical. This is how the Japanese mod was made - all I had to do was the flip the headers to LE.

### MUS 

TODO, looks like MIDI?

### SAM 

TODO, also FSB4?
