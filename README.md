# pyDXHR

Originally a fork of [rrika/dxhr](https://github.com/rrika/dxhr) because I wanted to fix a couple of things so that the workflow is a bit smoother between the game files to Blender to Unreal Engine 5 ([a different project of mine](https://six.vardonir.com/)).

And _then_ it went out of control.
