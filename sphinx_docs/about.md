# About

pyDXHR was intended for use in another project of mine: [Project SI-X](https://six.vardonir.com/). I wanted a pipeline to go from game files to a usable model format with as minimal processes in the middle.

I'm mostly just piecing together bits and pieces of code, mostly from the [DXHR decompilation project](https://github.com/rrika/cdcEngineDXHR/), stitching together a few external libraries here and there because I'm lazy, maybe finding a few neat little things along the way...

I think I went too far.

I may or may not have asked for this.
