# XBox 

The base game came in one CD. DC came as a 2-CD package.

Allegedly, there's a Japanese version of the base game. For the 6 people in Japan who own an XBox 360, I guess.

## Beta?

You can find it somewhere in archive.org.

It appears to be available only in Polish. Inspection of the game files seems to indicate that it only covers the first few levels of the game, there are only Detroit DRMs in there.
