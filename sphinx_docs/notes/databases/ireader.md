## Additional notes 

From `ireader.py`:

    _u3 seems to be sometimes nonzero - I've noticed it in two of the Taggart and Sarif ebooks, with the same title.
        Check out 21399 and 20946 or 19512 and 76737
    _u7 appears to be the doctorate achievement flag. It's set to 200 on 24844 (one of the Darrow ebooks), which is also the EXP value you get from reading said ebook. 
    the rest of the _u values appear to be zeroes

TODO: Currently, the code does not support adding an author to an ebook that didn't have an author to begin with - this is because `ireader_database.drm` itself needs to be modified to point to the correct text offset in `locals.bin`.
